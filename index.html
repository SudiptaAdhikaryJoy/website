        Say, Valiant,
        Say: High is my head!
        Looking at my head
        Is cast down the great Himalayan peak!
        Say, Valiant,
        Say: Ripping apart the wide sky of the universe,
        Leaving behind the moon, the sun, the planets
        and the stars
        Piercing the earth and the heavens,
        Pushing through Almighty’s sacred seat
        Have I risen,
        I, the perennial wonder of mother-earth!
        The angry God shines on my forehead
        Like some royal victory’s gorgeous emblem.
        Say, Valiant,
        Ever high is my head!
